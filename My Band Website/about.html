        <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)" target="_blank">Queen</a></strong> are a British
            rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead
            vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums, vocals).
            Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually
            ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock
            and pop rock. Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan
            of Smile and
            encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and
            suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their eponymous
            debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart
            Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter
            featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the
            music video format.
        </p>
        <p>The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", which have
            become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in
            the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981
            compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in
            the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert has been ranked among the greatest in rock history by
            various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In
            1991, he died of bronchopneumonia - a complication of AIDS, and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and
            Taylor have toured under the "Queen +" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.
